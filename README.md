# Overview

Looking for ways to improve my skills I decided to build a fun but practical project for learning. I developed a Memory Card Game, a classic game that challenges players to match pairs of cards. The main objective behind this project was to dive deeper into JavaScript and explore its capabilities in creating interactive web applications. Through this process, I aimed to gain a more profound understanding of JavaScript syntax, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

The game I developed is simple yet engaging. It consists of a grid of cards that are initially presented face down. Players turn over two cards at a time, with the goal of finding matching pairs. Matches remain face up, while non-matches are turned back over. The game continues until all pairs are found. This project allowed me to experiment with and implement various JavaScript concepts, including closures, the 'this' keyword, and the event loop, among others

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): This powerful and versatile code editor was my primary tool for writing and editing the source code. Its rich ecosystem of extensions and built-in support for JavaScript made it an excellent choice for this project.
- Google Chrome Developer Tools: For testing and debugging, Chrome's Developer Tools were invaluable. They allowed me to inspect the DOM, debug JavaScript code, and test the game's responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- GitHub: I used GitHub for version control, which helped me manage changes to the codebase and keep track of different development phases.
  
The programming language at the heart of this project is JavaScript, complemented by HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the game's interface. No external libraries were used in this project; the focus was on vanilla JavaScript to deepen my understanding of its core principles.

# Future Work

- Add difficulty levels: Introducing varying levels of difficulty, such as changing the number of cards or introducing time limits, could make the game more challenging and engaging.
- Implement a scoring system: Keeping track of the number of attempts and successfully matched pairs could add a competitive element to the game.
- Mobile responsiveness: While the game is playable on desktop browsers, optimizing the layout and interactions for mobile devices would enhance accessibility and user experience.
